# Uncommon Tailwind CSS Bugs

This repository demonstrates two uncommon bugs that can occur when using Tailwind CSS:

1. **Gradient Issues:** Incorrectly specifying colors in a gradient can lead to unexpected results or errors.
2. **Conflicting Class Declarations:**  The order of classes can significantly impact styling due to class overrides.

The `bug.js` file showcases these problems, and `bugSolution.js` provides solutions.
