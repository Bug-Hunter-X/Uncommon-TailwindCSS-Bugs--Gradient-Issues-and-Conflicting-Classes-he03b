```javascript
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature.  However, if the `from` and `to` colors are not properly specified (e.g., using incorrect color names or values), the gradient might not render correctly or might throw an unexpected error.

Another issue can be related to the order of class declarations. Tailwind processes classes from left to right.  If you have conflicting classes affecting the same property, the last one will override previous ones.
For example, if you have `text-red-500 text-blue-500`, only blue will be applied.
